This work investigates sharpness as a theoretical proxy for generalization in SDD and applies Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for better and more stable performance across diverse unseen test sets.



## Data Preparation
Our experiments utilize the following datasets:
- 19LA: [ASVspoof2019 LA](https://www.asvspoof.org/index2019.html)
- 21LA & 21DF: [ASVspoof2021 LA & DF](https://www.asvspoof.org/index2021.html)
- ITW: [In_The_Wild](https://deepfake-total.com/in_the_wild)
- FOR: [FakeOrReal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedabdeldayem/the-fake-or-real-dataset)
- WF: [WaveFake](https://zenodo.org/records/5642694)
- ADD: [ADD2022 evaluation set](https://zenodo.org/records/12188055)
- SC: [SpoofCeleb evaluation set](https://www.jungjee.com/spoofceleb/)

## Environment Setup
Clone the specific version of Fairseq:
[Fairseq Repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/a54021305d6b3c4c5959ac9395135f63202db8f1)

Install Fairseq in editable mode:
```bash
pip install --editable ./
```

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Training and Evaluation
Train (single or multiple gpu on slurm):
```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml --exp_dir exp/debug
```

Evaluate (single gpu):
```bash
python evaluate.py --exp_dir exp/debug --epoch best --eval 19LA
# Or batch evaluation
bash scripts/evaluate.sh
```

## Analysis and Visualization

Compute sharpness (single gpu):
```bash
python compute_sharp.py --exp_dir exp/debug --epoch best --eval 19LA
# Or batch evaluation
bash scripts/sharpness.sh
```

Compute sharpness and eer for subsets (single gpu):
```bash
python evalute_sharp.py --exp_dir exp/debug --epoch best --test 1
```

Plot loss landscape (single gpu):
```bash
python plot_loss_landscape.py --exp_dir exp/debug --epoch best
```
